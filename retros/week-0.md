**Guiding Questions** (consider before the meeting):

  *  What went well? 
    Everyone took ownership of the parts that they were interested as well as lending time and expertise on debugging other elements.
  *  What should we do differently next time?
    Nothing.
  *  What did we learn?
    A lot about maps, database and login authorization.
  *  What still puzzles us?
    We're still learning about all of the map capabilites. There are still elements of the app we havne't approached yet (geofence, possible video feature, etc).

  Perhaps communicate more.

**Mentor Comments**:
We were advised to hold off on creating  a completely hands-off user commentary feature we were considering. It would allow users to leave messages that others could see based on the location of their devices. Without adequate moderation, however, this could backfire by creating a means for ill-intententioned users to leave negative messages, ironically creating a space for harassment.
